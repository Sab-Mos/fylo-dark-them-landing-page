### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

This project served as a warm-up for the skills I have been acquiring throughout the last few months in the fundamentals of front-end development, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Since I enjoy incorporating new features in projects to test my skills, I also added JavaScript code for email validation, which informs the user with a pop-up message that the input email is not valid in case it does not match with the regular expression pattern that I provided.

Regarding media queries, I have also set up CSS for the landscape mode of mobile devices to ensure compatibility in that view

### Continued development

As someone who considers themselves a beginner in this field for now, I strive to daily improve my existing skills. Of course, when it comes to code cleanliness and other details primarily involving JavaScript, I acknowledge that I still have a long way to go. That's why I focus on improving the flaws I notice in my working process. My future goals are centered on improving my JavaScript skills and starting the learning process of React to gain more experience and knowledge in the field of front-end development.
